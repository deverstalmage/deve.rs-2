  h2 The Bulletin

  p #[strong Description:] #[a(href='http://bulletin.represent.us/', target='_blank') The Bulletin] is a news blog run by #[a(href='https://represent.us/') Represent.Us]. The site is a single page application powered by #[a(href='https://angularjs.org/', target='_blank') AngularJS] and #[a(href='https://wordpress.org/', target='_blank') WordPress], in conjunction with a  #[a(href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/', target='_blank') JSON API plugin]. Initial page data (in the form of inline JSON) is rendered by the server, and loads subsequent data via AJAX requests from the bootstrapped JavaScript application. This combination gives fast page load times while not sacrificing the responsiveness of a client-side app. The sites architecture was inspired by #[a(href='http://qz.com/', target='_blank') qz.com] and #[a(href='https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-on-twittercom', target='_blank') Twitter&rsquo;s 2012 optimizations].
  p #[strong My involvement:] I completely built both the bootstrapped AngularJS app, as well as the underlying WordPress theme.
  h2 Represent.Us
    a(href='https://represent.us/', target='_blank')
      img(src='images/newtab.png', class='icon')
  p #[strong Description:] #[a(href='https://represent.us/', target='_blank') Represent.Us] is a campaign working to end currently legal corruption that is ravaging the political system. The sites serves as both an informational hub for the campaign &amp; movement at large, as well as an online action-taking platform for our supporters and activists. The site is powered by #[a(href='https://wordpress.org/', target='_blank') WordPress], and runs on a custom theme that facilitates and prioritizes sharing and further user engagement through mailing lists and other forms of outreach. The site integrates with #[a(href='http://actionkit.com/', target='_blank') ActionKit] via an in-house built WordPress plugin, ActionPress.
  p #[strong My involvement:] I single-handedly developed the Represent.Us site (along with the ActionPress plugin) from its launch in late 2012 until mid 2014 when Represent.Us hired a second developer to assist on our assorted online properties and projects, including the Represent.Us website. Now, I maintain and upgrade the site on a day-to-day basis with various improvments and features.

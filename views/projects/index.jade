  p Below are descriptions of a few of the projects that I have worked on, at past jobs and in my freetime.

  p #[a(href='http://bulletin.represent.us/', target='_blank') The Bulletin] is a news blog run by #[a(href='https://represent.us/') Represent.Us]. The site is a single page application powered by #[a(href='https://wordpress.org/', target='_blank') WordPress], in conjunction with a  #[a(href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/', target='_blank') JSON API plugin]. Initial page data (in the form of inline JSON) is rendered by the server, and loads subsequent data via AJAX requests from the bootstrapped JavaScript application. This combination gives fast page load times while not sacrificing the responsiveness of a client-side app. The sites architecture was inspired by #[a(href='http://qz.com/', target='_blank') qz.com] and #[a(href='https://blog.twitter.com/2012/improving-performance-on-twittercom', target='_blank') Twitter&rsquo;s 2012 optimizations].
